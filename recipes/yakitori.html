    <h2>Remember to baste frequently for best flavor! </h2>
    <p>These grilled chicken skewers are classic food-on-a-stick street food that you can easily make at home. "Chicken yakitori is an easy Japanese dish to make at home. Serve with white rice and sake for an easy but special meal!" says ChefJackie. You might also like Beef Yakitori. </p>
